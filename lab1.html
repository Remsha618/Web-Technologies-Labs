<p>I am <b>Remsha Imtiaz</b> from <i>Abbottabad. </i><br>I am a <u>student.</u> <br> I know the world moves fast, and sometimes it feels like I’m running just to keep up. But today, I want to pause and look inward. I want to remind myself of something I often forget: I am not behind—I am exactly where I need to be.
I’ve walked through struggles no one else fully understands, and yet I’m still standing. Stronger, wiser, and more capable than I give myself credit for. Every obstacle I’ve faced has added to my strength, even when I didn’t notice it happening.
I am a work in progress, and that is beautiful. I don’t need to have all the answers yet. What matters is that I continue, step by step, with patience and with courage.
I deserve peace, I deserve joy, and I deserve to believe in myself as much as I believe in others.
So here’s my promise: I will be kinder to myself. I will celebrate my small wins, forgive my mistakes, and trust that my path is unfolding in its own perfect way.
Because I am enough. I always have been. </p>
